```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
abalone <- read_csv('C:\\Users\\carly\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Temp1_homework-2.zip\\homework-2\\data\\abalone.csv')
1. 
```{r}
abalone <- abalone %>% 
mutate(age = rings + 1.5)
abalone %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = age))+ geom_histogram(bins = 60)
```
Age seems to be normally distributed, although slightly positively skewed, with 11 being roughly the mean age, although it has a few older outliers.
2. 
```{r}
set.seed(111)
abalone_split <- initial_split(abalone, prop = 0.80, strata = 'age')
abalone_train <- training(abalone_split)
abalone_test <- testing(abalone_split)
```
